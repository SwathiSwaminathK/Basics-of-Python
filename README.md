# Basics of Python
## Introduction
Popular high-level programming language Python was created for all-purpose programming. Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was originally made available as Python 0.9.0 in 1991 as a replacement for the ABC programming language.

Python was created with a focus on code readability, enabling programmers to express their ideas in less code. It is mostly utilised for the creation of software, the production of websites, system scripting, and the execution of mathematical operations.

Python's syntax is more plain, clear, and elegant than other programming languages, allowing for the creation of code in less lines. It is the perfect language for the quick creation of applications since it is both an interpreted language and an object-oriented programming language.

Python is a free and open-source programming language that may be used and distributed in any way, including for profit. It includes a sizable standard library that is open source or freely downloadable in binary form.

### Python used for:
* **Web/App development:** 

    Python is a great choice for developing websites and mobile applications. There are several free Python modules and frameworks that facilitate quick and effective development.
* **Data analytics:** 

    Python is widely used in data science to handle massive volumes of information, alter data, and perform repetitive operations.
* **Data visualisation:**

    Numerous data visualisation packages, including Pandas and Plotly, are available in Python.
* **AI and machine learning:**

    Python is the best programming language for creating applications for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). It is a strong, flexible, and simple      programming language that provides clear and understandable code for implementing complicated algorithms.
* **Prototyping:**

    Python is an interpreted language that facilitates quick application development. As a result, it is often used to prototype applications before they are created.
