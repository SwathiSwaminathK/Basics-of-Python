    "### Naming a Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Python only allows letters (a-z, A-B), integers, or underscores (_) as variable names. However, a number cannot be the first character. So, instead of 2userName, you may name your variables userName, user_name, or userName2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, because they have predetermined meanings in Python, many reserved terms cannot be used as variable names. These terms include phrases like \"print,\" \"input,\" \"if,\" \"while,\" and others. Each of these will be covered in later chapters. Variable names also differ depending on the case. username and userName are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming a variable in Python, there are two standards to follow. Either camel case notation or underscores are options. Writing complex words in mixed case is known as the camel case (for example, thisIsAVariableName). Another standard method is to separate the words using underscores ( ). You may name your variables like this : this is a variable name."
